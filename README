Pinephone bash Scripts for SMS, VOICE-CALL and more


besides needing a basic mobian installation the following packages need to be installed to have things work: sway, waybar, swayidle, modemmanager, callaudiod, xterm, squeekboard, pulseaudio, mobian-pinephone-tweaks, brightnessctl, (consolation), eg25-manager, foot, ...

remember that network-managaer needs to be replaced with iwd: 

	$ apt-cache purge network-manager
	$ apt-cache install iwd

add the following two lines to /etc/sudoers (use $ sudo visudo ):

mobian ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/systemctl stop eg25-manager.service, /usr/bin/systemctl start eg25-manager.service
mobian ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/systemctl disable eg25-manager.service, /usr/bin/systemctl enable eg25-manager.service

if your username is not mobian change mobian to your username

make sure you are a member of the group input:

	$ adduser mobian input

copy all files in bin/* into a path where they can be found and executed ($PATH).

copy all directories in config to .config in your home folder.

inspect the sway config file and change it to your liking.

the Ringtones folder needs to be in your $HOME folder.

	$ contact add
		nickname: max
