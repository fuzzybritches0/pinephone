Pinephone bash Scripts for SMS, VOICE-CALL and more


Beside needing a basic mobian installation the following packages need to be
installed to have things work: sway, swayidle, modemmanager,
callaudiod, foot, wvkbd*, pulseaudio, mobian-pinephone-tweaks,
brightnessctl, eg25-manager, lisgd**, wofi***, ...

**  https://github.com/fuzzybritches0/lisgd/tree/debian
*** https://github.com/fuzzybritches0/wofi/tree/debian 

remember that network-managaer needs to be replaced with iwd: 

$ apt-cache install iwd

$ apt-cache purge network-manager 

copy all files in bin/* into a path where they can be found and executed
($PATH).

copy sway config into $HOME/.config/sway

the Ringtones folder needs to be in your $HOME folder.

add a new contact:

$ contact add

nickname: max
name: max musterman
telephone: +1234567890

call max:

$ voice call max

call someone by phone number:

$ voice call +1234567890

send max an sms:

$ sms send max hi there this is an sms\!

check new sms:

$ sms

list conversation with max:

$ sms list max

calls and missed calls get saved in ~/CALLS/*, however a human readable
function is not implemented yet.
