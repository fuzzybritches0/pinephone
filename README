Pinephone bash Scripts for SMS, VOICE-CALL and more


Beside needing a basic mobian installation the following packages need to be
installed to have things work: sway, swayidle, modemmanager,
callaudiod, foot, wvkbd*, pulseaudio, mobian-pinephone-tweaks,
brightnessctl, eg25-manager, lisgd**, wofi***, wtype, ...

**  https://github.com/fuzzybritches0/lisgd/tree/debian
*** https://github.com/fuzzybritches0/wofi/tree/debian 

remember that network-managaer needs to be replaced with iwd: 

$ apt-cache install iwd

$ apt-cache purge network-manager 

copy all files in bin/* into a path where they can be found and executed
($PATH).

copy sway config into $HOME/.config/sway

the Ringtones folder needs to be in your $HOME folder.

add a new contact:

$ contact add

nickname: max
name: max musterman
telephone: +1234567890

call max:

$ voice call max

call someone by phone number:

$ voice call +1234567890

send max an sms:

$ sms send max hi there this is an sms\!

check new sms:

$ sms

list conversation with max:

$ sms list max

calls and missed calls get saved in ~/CALLS/*, however a human readable
function is not implemented yet.

to prevent the phone from suspending while being logged in via ssh, add
the following lines at the end of your .bashrc (note the path to
inhibit_idle may differ in your case). (turn off the screen by pressing
the power button):

if [ "${SSH_CONNECTION}" ] && [ "$(ls /run/user/${UID} | grep sway-ipc.${UID}.)" ]; then
	export SWAYSOCK=$(ls /run/user/${UID}/sway-ipc.${UID}.*.sock)
	export WAYLAND_DISPLAY="$(basename /run/user/${UID}/wayland-?)"
	/home/${USER}/bin/inhibit_idle &
fi
